I'm Harshit Dubey, a video game programmer with ~3 years of experience. I have worked on a variety of games of different genres for smartphones on both iOS and Android platforms using the Unity game engine.

I'm also an avid gamer and am fond of narrative-driven as well as competitive multiplayer games. Although, currently I work on smartphone games of smaller scale and scope which have become immensely popular due to the sudden rise of mobile gaming, my aim is to make better video games for consoles and PC.

I'm primarily a programmer, but I frequently dabble in the game design and a bit of creative coding.
